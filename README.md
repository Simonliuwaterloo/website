# personal-website-3.0
The third iteration of my personal website.  
You can take a look at the first iteration [here](https://github.com/Simonliuwaterloo/mywebsite) and the second iteration [here](https://github.com/Simonliuwaterloo/jianyanli), to see how much my front-end skills have grown.  
Will there be a personal-website-4.0? Of course. My plan is to add a blog section... and maybe host it somewhere else so it doesn't have to be static.
